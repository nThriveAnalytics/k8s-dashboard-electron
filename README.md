# K8s Dashboard in an Electron App

This app runs the Kubernetes dashboard from within an electron app. The app runs `kubectl proxy` as a background process on startup.

## Setup

```
npm i
```

## Test

```
npm start
```

## Make

```
npm run make
```

This will generate an application bundle in the out directory, which can be installed on your local machine.
